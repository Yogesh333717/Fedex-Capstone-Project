# FedEx Logistics EDA

A data-driven project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a FedEx logistics dataset containing over 10,000 shipment records. The goal is to uncover insights, identify cost-saving opportunities, and enhance the efficiency of FedEx's logistics operations.

### üîç Project Highlights:
- Cleaned and transformed a dataset with 10,324 entries and 33 features
- Analyzed key metrics like **freight cost**, **shipment mode**, **delivery time**, and **vendor performance**
- Explored relationships between **weight and cost**, **line item value**, and **delivery delays**
- Used **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** in **Jupyter Notebook** for visualization and insights
- Delivered actionable insights to:
  - Reduce freight costs
  - Improve delivery timelines
  - Optimize vendor relationships
  - Support data-driven decision-making

### üìä Key Findings:
- Air Charter mode leads to highest shipping costs
- Generic products dominate procurement, offering cost benefits
- Delivery delays peaked between 2010‚Äì2014; improvements seen post-2014
- Freight cost is moderately correlated with shipment weight
